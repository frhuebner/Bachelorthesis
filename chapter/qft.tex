\section{Klein-Gordon-Field}
(Quelle: Birell)\todo{Quelle}
Consider a massless complex Klein-Gordon-field in a curved spacetime with metric \(g_{\mu\nu}\) given by the lagrangian:
\begin{align}
\mathcal{L} &= -\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{|g|} g^{\mu\nu} \partial_\mu \phi\,\partial_\nu \phi 
\end{align}

The equation of motion is given by the Klein-Gordon-equation:
\begin{align}
\sqrt{|g|}\nabla_\mu\nabla^\mu \phi = \partial_\mu \left(\sqrt{|g|} g^{\mu\nu} \partial_\nu \phi\right) = 0
\end{align}

For solutions we also require to drop to zero at the boundary. Define a scalar product of two such solutions $\phi, \psi$ over a Cauchysurface \(\Sigma\) via:
\begin{align}
(\phi|\psi) &:= i \int_{\Sigma} \mathrm{d}S^\mu\, \phi^*\nabla_\mu \psi - \psi\nabla_\mu \phi^* = i \int_{\Sigma} \mathrm{d}S^\mu\, \phi^*\overset{\leftrightarrow}{\nabla}_\mu \psi
\end{align}

(Quelle: Townsend)The scalar product is independent of the choice of \(\Sigma\): Assume two Cauchysurfaces \(\Sigma\), \(\Sigma'\) and denote the 'sandwiched' region between them by \(A\). Then by Gauss' law
\begin{align}
(\phi|\psi) - (\phi|\psi)' &= i\int_{\Sigma}\mathrm{d}S^\mu\, \phi^*\nabla_\mu \psi - \psi\nabla_\mu \phi^* - \int_{\Sigma'}\mathrm{d}S^\mu\, \phi^*\nabla_\mu \psi - \psi\nabla_\mu \phi^*\\
	&= i\int_{A} \sqrt{|g|} \mathrm{d^4}x\,\nabla^\mu \left(\phi^*\nabla_\mu \psi - \psi\nabla_\mu \phi^*\right)\\
	&= i\int_{A} \sqrt{|g|} \mathrm{d^4}x\,\phi^*\nabla^\mu\nabla_\mu \psi - \psi \nabla^\mu\nabla_\mu\phi^* = 0.
\label{equ:qft_scalarproduct_invariant}
\end{align}

Note that \((\phi^*|\psi^*) = -(\phi|\psi)^*\) and \((\phi|\psi)^* = (\psi|\phi)\).\\

Now choose a complete set of solutions $\{u_i\}$, such that
\begin{align}
(u_i| u_j) = \delta_{ij},\,(u_i^*| u_j^*) = -\delta_{ij}\,\text{and}\,(u_i^*| u_j) = 0
\end{align}

The completeness of the modes implies that \((\phi|\psi) = \sum_i (\phi|u_i)(u_i|\psi) - (\phi|u_i^*)(u_i^*|\psi)\).



\section{Quantisation, Bogolyubov Transformations and Vacua}

(Quelle: arXiv1011.5875 )We can quantize the field by introducing the canonical commutation relations CCR on a cauchysurface \(\Sigma\) with (future directed) normal vector $S^\mu$:

\begin{align}
[\phi(x),\phi(x')]_\Sigma &= 0\\
[\phi(x),\nabla_S \phi(x')]_\Sigma &= i\delta(x-x')\\
[\nabla_S \phi(x),\nabla_S \phi(x')]_\Sigma &= 0\\
\end{align}

One can show that if they hold on one cauchysurface they hold on every cauchysurface\todo{Quelle}.\\
Given a complete set of modes this leads to \(\phi = \sum_i u_i a_i + u_i^* a_i^\dagger\), with \(a\) a bosonic annihilation operator satisfying \([a_i,a_j^\dagger] = \delta_{ij}\).\\

Of course there are many different complete sets. One could also expand it in a different set \(\{v_j\}\): \(\phi = \sum_j v_j b_j + v_j^* b_j^\dagger\). The b's are then given by 
\begin{align}
b_j = \sum_i (v_j|u_i) a_i + (v_j|u_i*) a_i^\dagger
\label{equ:qft_bogolyubov}
\end{align}
This is called a Bogolyubov transformation.\\

So far everything was in complete analogy to quantisation in Minkowskispace. However problems arise when one tries to define the ground state of the system which is defined as the state with the lowest energy. To see this choose a co-moving frame w.r.t \(\hat{S}\) and calculate the hamiltonian \todo{wrong}
\begin{align}
H_\Sigma &= \int_\Sigma \dd[3]{x} \pi \partial_0 \phi - \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{|g|} \partial_0 \phi \partial_0 \phi + \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{|g|} g^{ij} \partial_i \phi \partial_j \phi\\
	&= \int_\Sigma \dd[3]{x} \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{|g|} \partial_0 \phi \partial_0 \phi - \frac{1}{2} \phi \partial_i\qty(\sqrt{|g|} g^{ij}  \partial_j \phi)\\
%	&= \int \dd[3]{x} \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{|g|} \partial_0 \phi \partial_0 \phi - \frac{1}{2} \phi \partial_0 \qty(\sqrt{|g|}\partial_0 \phi)\\
	&= \int_\Sigma \dd[3]{x} \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{|g|} \partial_0 \phi \partial_0 \phi - \frac{1}{2} \phi \sqrt{|g|} \partial_0^2 \phi + \frac{1}{2} \phi \partial_0\qty(\sqrt{|g|} g^{00}) \partial_0 \phi  
\end{align}

where we used \(g_{00} = g^{00} = -1\) and the Klein-Gordon-equation. Now we would like to define the groundstate as the state with the lowest energy. To check whether this is a suitable definition choose two cauchysurfaces  \(\Sigma, \Sigma'\) and determine the difference between their hamiltonians. To do this choose for \(\partial_0\) a vectorfield that matches with \(\\hat{S}\) on both surfaces:
\begin{align}
H_\Sigma - H_\Sigma' &= \frac{1}{2}\int_A  \sqrt{|g|} \dd[4]{x} \nabla_\mu \qty(\nabla^\mu \phi \partial_0 \phi - \phi \nabla^\mu\partial_0 \phi) + \nabla_\mu \qty(\frac{1}{\sqrt{|g|}}\phi \partial_0 \qty(\sqrt{|g|} g^{\mu\nu}) \partial_\nu \phi)\\
	&= \frac{1}{2}\int_A  \sqrt{|g|} \dd[4]{x} \nabla^\mu \phi \nabla_\mu \partial_0 \phi - \nabla_\mu \phi \nabla^\mu\partial_0 \phi - \phi \nabla_\mu\nabla^\mu \partial_0 \phi + \frac{1}{\sqrt{|g|}} \partial_\mu \qty(\phi \partial_0 \qty(\sqrt{|g|} g^{\mu\nu}) \partial_\nu \phi)\\
	&= \frac{1}{2}\int_A  \dd[4]{x} - \phi \partial_\mu\qty(\sqrt{|g|} g^{\mu\nu}\partial_\nu \partial_0 \phi) + \partial_\mu \qty(\phi \partial_0 \qty(\sqrt{|g|} g^{\mu\nu}) \partial_\nu \phi)\\
	&= \frac{1}{2}\int_A  \dd[4]{x} \phi \partial_\mu\qty(\partial_0 \qty(\sqrt{|g|} g^{\mu\nu})\partial_\nu\phi) + \partial_\mu \qty(\phi \partial_0 \qty(\sqrt{|g|} g^{\mu\nu}) \partial_\nu \phi)
\end{align} 

This remaining term will not drop in general\footnote{For example take a diagonal metric which depends on time.}. This means that different cauchysurfaces will assign different energies to the same state\footnote{This is not so surprising because in general the field couples to the spacetime and therefore exchanges energy with it.}. This means we can't define a groundstate on a spacetime trivially. However in Minkowskispace the remaining terms are 0 (since the metric is constant). So in flat space there exists a well defined (the vacuumstate) on which all possible global co-moving frames (not only inertial ones) agree to be the groundstate of the system. 

In a static spacetime it is natural to consider cauchysurfaces \(t = \mathrm{const.}\). Since then \(\hat{S} \sim \partial_t\) the difference of \(H\) on two such surfaces will vanish (Recall that the metric of a static spacetime does not depend on \(t\) which implies \(\partial_0\qty(\sqrt{|g|} g^{\mu\nu}) = 0\) ). So for all times we have a natural candidate for the groundstate by choosing the lowest state of this hamiltonian.

For other spacetimes it is convenient to choose the groundstate on a cauchysurface which lies far in the past (as in a scattering problem). For example when treating a collapsing star we will choose the groundstate of the (static) spacetime before the collapse (which will then eventually convert into an excited state).    

Because in our examples the vacuum state will coincide with the groundstate at least in the beginning we will denote them by \(\ket*{0}\).

\section{Greens functions}
(Quelle: Birell Davies)
\subsection{Vacuum Greens function}
After defining the Groundstate of the QFT on can define several Greens functions (there are many more, but we will only need those):
\begin{itemize}
	\item The Wightman function \(D^+(x,x') := \bra{0}\phi(x)\phi(x')\ket{0}\)
 	\item Expectationvalue of the commutator: \(i D(x,x') := [\phi(x),\phi(x')] = 2i\,\mathrm{Im}\,D^+(x,x')\)
	\item Expectationvalue of the anticommutator \(D^{(1)}(x,x') := \bra{0}\{\phi(x),\phi(x')\}\ket{0}= 2\,\mathrm{Re}\,D^+(x,x')\)
\end{itemize}

One does not need to take the expectationvalue of the commutator since (using the commutation relations) it is a c-number.
\begin{align}
i D(x,x') &= \sum_{i,j} [u_i(x) a_i + u_i^*(x) a_i^\dagger, u_j(x') a_j + u_j^*(x') a_j^\dagger] \\
	&= \sum_{i} u_i(x) u_i^*(x') - u_i^*(x) u_i(x')  
\end{align}

Since \(\nabla^\mu\nabla_mu\phi(x) = 0\) this also holds for all Greensfunctions, i.e \(\nabla^\mu\nabla_\mu D^+(x,x') = 0\).

If the ground state is defined as \(a_i\ket{0} = 0\) for a complete set of modes \(u_i\) (as for example for positiv frequency modes in a static spacetime) we can calculate \(D^+(\vb{x},\vb{x}')\) by summing over all modes:\\

\begin{align}
D^+(\vb{x},\vb{x}') &= \bra{0}\phi(\vb{x})\phi(\vb{x}')\ket{0}\\
	&= \sum_{ij} \bra{0} \qty(u_i(\vb{x}) a_i + u_i^*(\vb{x}) a_i^\dagger)\qty(u_j(\vb{x}') a_j + u_j^*(\vb{x}') a_j^\dagger) \ket{0} \\
	&= \sum_{ij} u_i(\vb{x}) u_j^*(\vb{x}') \bra{0} a_i a_j^\dagger \ket{0} \\
	&= \sum_{ij} u_i(\vb{x}) u_j^*(\vb{x}') \delta_{ij} \\
	&= \sum_{i} u_i(\vb{x}) u_i^*(\vb{x}')
\label{equ:wightman_modes}
\end{align}

\subsection{Thermal Greens function}
Later we will also need thermal greens function. These are given by replacing the vacuum expectation value \(\bra{0} \dots \ket{0}\) by the thermal expectation value \(\langle\dots\rangle_\beta = \frac{1}{Z} \mathrm{Tr} e^{-\beta H} \dots \) with \(\beta = \frac{1}{k_B T}\),  the hamiltonian \(H\) and \(Z = Tr e^{-\beta H}\).\\

First observe that since \(i D(x,x') = [\phi(x),\phi(x')]\) is a c-number \(D(x,x')\) it has the same value as in the vacuum case.\\
Using \(\phi(t,\vec{x}) = e^{i H t}\phi(0)e^{-i H t}\) we obtain:
\begin{align}
D^+_\beta = \frac{1}{Z} \mathrm{Tr} e^{-\beta H} \phi(x)\phi(x')
\end{align}
\missingfigure{}
TODO: thermal greens function

Therefore we can calculate \(D^{(1)}_\beta(t,\vec{x};t',\vec{x}') = \sum_k D^{(1)}(t+i\beta k, \vec{x};t',\vec{x}')\).



\section{Particle Detectors}
The treatment of a particle detector follows (Quelle: Birell Davies) and goes back to Unruh. One describes a detector by a operator \(m(\tau)\) which couples to the field via a interaction term \(c\cdot m(\tau) \phi(x(\tau))\), where \(c\) is small and \(x(\tau)\) is the trajectory of the detector. For \(\tau \to -\infty\) the detector is in the groundstate \(\ket{E_0}\) and the field is in the vacuum state \(\ket{0}\). The detector develops with time according to \(m(\tau) = e^{i H_0 \tau} m(0) e^{-i H_0 \tau}\) with \(H_0 \ket{E} = E\ket{E}\).\\
We would like to calculate the probability that the detector detects a particle with energy \(E\). Since \(c\) is small one can use first order perturbation theory where the transition amplitude to another state \(\ket{E,\psi}\) at time \(\tau\) is given by
\begin{align}
A_{\ket{E_0,0}\to\ket{E,\psi}}(\tau) &= i c \bra{E,\psi} \int_{-\infty}^\tau m(\tau') \phi(x(\tau'))\mathrm{d}\tau'\ket{E_0,0}\\
	&= i c \bra{E,\psi} \int_{-\infty}^\tau e^{i H_0 \tau'} m(0) e^{-i H_0 \tau'} \phi(x(\tau'))\mathrm{d}\tau'\ket{E_0,0}\\
	&= i c \bra{\psi} \int_{-\infty}^\tau e^{i E \tau'} \bra{E}m(0)\ket{E_0}  e^{-i E_0 \tau'} \phi(x(\tau'))\mathrm{d}\tau'\ket{0}\\
	&= i c \bra{E}m(0)\ket{E_0} \int_{-\infty}^\tau e^{i (E-E_0) \tau'} \bra{\psi}\phi(x(\tau'))\ket{0}\mathrm{d}\tau'\\
\end{align}

The transition probability is \(P_{\ket{E_0,0}\to\ket{E,\psi}}(\tau) = |A_{\ket{E_0,0}\to\ket{E,\psi}}(\tau)|^2\). But since we are only interested in the state of the detector we sum over all field configurations:
\begin{align}
P_E(\tau) &:= \sum_{i} P_{\ket{E_0,0}\to\ket{E,\psi_i}}(\tau) = \sum_{i}  |A_{\ket{E_0,0}\to\ket{E,\psi}}(\tau)|^2\\
		  &= c^2 |\bra{E}m(0)\ket{E_0}|^2 F_{E-E_0}(\tau)\\
\text{with}\,F_E(\tau) &= \sum_{i}\left|\int_{-\infty}^\tau e^{i (E-E_0) \tau} \bra{\psi_i}\phi(x(\tau'))\ket{0}\mathrm{d}\tau'\right|^2\\
	&= \sum_{i} \int_{-\infty}^\tau e^{-i E \tau''} \bra{0}\phi(x(\tau''))\mathrm{d}\tau''\ket{\psi_i}\bra{\psi_i}\int_{-\infty}^\tau e^{i E \tau'} \phi(x(\tau'))\ket{0}\mathrm{d}\tau'\\
	&= \int_{-\infty}^\tau\mathrm{d}\tau' \int_{-\infty}^\tau \mathrm{d}\tau'' e^{-i E (\tau''-\tau')} \bra{0}\phi(x(\tau'')) \phi(x(\tau'))\ket{0} := \int_{-\infty}^\tau\mathrm{d}\tau' \int_{-\infty}^\tau \mathrm{d}\tau'' e^{-i E (\tau''-\tau')} D^+(x(\tau''), x(\tau'))
\end{align}

There we introduced the Wightman function \(D^+(x,x') = \bra{0}\phi(x) \phi(x')\ket{0}\). The probability splits in a product of two parts. The first one only depends on the model of the detector while the second part only depends on the trajectory. We will therefore interpret the function \(F_E(\tau)\) as the distribution of energy excitations as been 'seen' by an observer on the trajectory \(x(\tau)\).\\
The transition rate is then given by:
\begin{align}
\cfrac{\mathrm{d}F_E(\tau)}{\mathrm{d}\tau} &= \int_{-\infty}^\tau \mathrm{d}\tau'' e^{-i E (\tau''-\tau)} D^+(x(\tau''), x(\tau)) \phi(x(\tau))\ket{0} + \int_{-\infty}^\tau \mathrm{d}\tau' e^{-i E (\tau-\tau')} D^+(x(\tau), x(\tau'))\\
&= \int_{-\infty}^\tau \mathrm{d}\tau' e^{-i E (\tau'-\tau)} D^+(x(\tau'), x(\tau)) + e^{-i E (\tau-\tau')} D^+(x(\tau), x(\tau'))\\
&\overset{\tilde{\tau} = \tau'-\tau}{=} \int_{-\infty}^0 \mathrm{d}\tilde{\tau} e^{-i E \tilde{\tau}} D^+(x(\tilde{\tau} + \tau), x(\tau)) + e^{i E \tilde{\tau}} D^+(x(\tau), x(\tilde{\tau} + \tau))\\
&= 2 \mathrm{Re} \int_{-\infty}^0 \mathrm{d}\tilde{\tau} e^{-i E \tilde{\tau}} D^+(x(\tilde{\tau} + \tau), x(\tau))
\end{align}

since \(D^+(x,x')^* = D^+(x',x)\). For the special case that the Wightman function does only depend on the difference of the \(\tau\text{'s}\), i.e. \(D^+(x(\tau_1 + \tau'),x(\tau_2 + \tau')) = D^+(x(\tau_1),x(\tau_2))\) one can simplify this further:

\begin{align}
\cfrac{\mathrm{d}F_E(\tau)}{\mathrm{d}\tau} &=  \int_{-\infty}^0 \mathrm{d}\tilde{\tau} e^{-i E \tilde{\tau}} D^+(x(\tilde{\tau} + \tau), x(\tau)) + \int_{0}^\infty \mathrm{d}\tilde{\tau} e^{- i E \tilde{\tau}} D^+(x(\tau), x(\tau - \tilde{\tau}))\\
&= \int_{-\infty}^0 \mathrm{d}\tilde{\tau} e^{-i E \tilde{\tau}} D^+(x(\tilde{\tau} + \tau), x(\tau)) + \int_{0}^\infty \mathrm{d}\tilde{\tau} e^{- i E \tilde{\tau}} D^+(x(\tau  + \tilde{\tau}), x(\tau))\\
&= \int_{-\infty}^\infty \mathrm{d}\tilde{\tau} e^{-i E \tilde{\tau}} D^+(x(\tilde{\tau} + \tau), x(\tau)) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \mathrm{d}\tilde{\tau} e^{-i E \tilde{\tau}} D^+(x(\tilde{\tau}), x(0))
\label{equ:detector_final}
\end{align}

The rate is the fouriertransform of the Wightman function and is independent of \(\tau\).\\

\section{QFT in Minkowskispace and the Unruh effect}
In order to get a feeling for the calculations in the last section it is useful to consider a simple example in minkowskispace, the Unruh effect: An observer with constant proper acceleration observes a heat bath when moving through minkowski vacuum.\\

\subsection{Solutions of the Klein-Gordon-Equation}

The Klein-Gordon-Equation in Minkowskispace is the normal wave equation:
\begin{align}
\partial_\mu\partial^\mu \phi = 0.
\end{align}

Since we are in Minkowskispace, \(\partial_t\) is a futuredirected timelike killing vector field. Therefore we can find a orthonormal set of positiv frequency solutions, which are just plane waves:
\begin{align}
u_{\vec{k}}(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 |k|}} \frac{e^{i k x}}{\sqrt{2\pi}^3},\,\text{with} k^0 = |k|
\end{align}
The prefactor \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2 |k|}}\) is required for normalisation \((u_{\vec{k}}|u_{\vec{k}'}) = \delta^3(\vec{k}-\vec{k}')\). It is natural to define the vacuum in Minkowskispace by \(a_{\vec{k}}\ket{0_M} = 0\). Throughout this paper we will always exclude the mode \(\omega = |\va{k}| = 0\)\footnote{This might seem a bit ad hoc first but it is mainly to exclude some \(\delta(\omega)\) terms which lead to clearly unphysical behaviour, e.g. an infinite transition rate to the groundstate of our detector.}. 

Since the Minkowskispace is also spherical symmetric one can also choose spherical modes
\begin{align}
u_{\omega,l,m}\upd{M} = \frac{\sqrt{\omega}}{\sqrt{\pi}} e^{- i \omega t} j_l(\omega r) Y_l^m(\theta,\phi),
\end{align} where \(j_l\) is a spherical Bessel function. The prefactor is again due to normalisation and can be achieved using the completeness relation for spherical Bessels \(\int_0^\infty r^2 \dd{r} j_l(w r) j_l(w' r) = \frac{\pi}{2\omega^2}\delta(\omega - \omega')\). For great distances from the origin one can approximate the Bessels by their asymptotic behaviour \(j_l(x) \overset{x \gg 1}{\to} \frac{\sin(x-l\frac{\pi}{2})}{x}\) and achieves:
\begin{align}
u_{\omega,l,m}\upd{M} \approx \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi\omega}} e^{- i \omega t} \frac{\sin(\omega r - l\frac{\pi}{2})}{r} Y_l^m(\theta,\phi)
\label{equ:bessel_asympt}
\end{align}

It is important to note that for this approximation it is necessary to have \(r \gg 1/\omega\). So if one fixes \(r\) than the approximation will break down for small \(\omega\).

\subsection{The Wigthmanfunction}

The Wightmanfunction is calculated in the appendix \todo{link}:
\begin{align}
D^+(x,x') &= -\frac{1}{4\pi^2} \frac{1}{(t-t'-i\varepsilon)^2 - |\vec{x}-\vec{x}'|^2}
\end{align}

Up to the small imaginary number \(i\varepsilon\) this is a real function. This means that the imaginary part (or \(D(x,x')\)) can only be non-vanishing if the denominator goes to \(0\) for \(\varepsilon \to 0\). This is only the case for lightlike seperated \(x\) and \(x'\) or equivalently if \(x\) is on the lightcone of \(x'\). This means when computing \(D^+(x(\tau),x(0))\) on a trajectory (like for a detector in eq. \ref{equ:detector_final}) the imaginary part will always vanish, since our detector stays strictly inside the lightcone\footnote{Of course there's also the case \(x = x'\) which we have to treat seperatly. But from the CCR we can conclude \(2i\,\mathrm{Im}\,D^+(x,x) = iD(x,x) = [\phi(x),\phi(x)] = 0\).}.

Since we will later use spherical modes in order to calculate \(D^+\) in the Schwarzschildmetric it is useful to have an expression for the Wightmanfunction in terms of the spherical modes. This is given by:
\begin{align}
D^+(\vb{x},\vb{x}') = \int_0^\infty \frac{\omega \dd{\omega}}{\pi} \sum_{l,m} e^{-i\omega(t-t')} j_l(\omega r) j_l(\omega r')  Y_l^m(\theta,\phi) Y_l^{m*}(\theta',\phi')
\end{align}

or when using the approximate forms for great \(r\)

\begin{align}
D^+(\vb{x},\vb{x}') = \int_0^\infty \frac{\dd{\omega}}{\pi\omega} \sum_{l,m} e^{-i\omega(t-t')} \frac{\sin(\omega r - l\frac{\pi}{2})}{r} \frac{\sin(\omega r' - l\frac{\pi}{2})}{r'} Y_l^m(\theta,\phi) Y_l^{m*}(\theta',\phi')
\label{equ:wightman_minkoski_spherical}
\end{align}

When using the approximate form two main problems occur. They can be seen by expanding \(\sin(\omega r - l\frac{\pi}{2}) = \frac{e^{i\omega r} i^{-l} - e^{-i\omega r} i^{l}}{2i}\).
\begin{enumerate}
\item After expanding one has to integrate \( \int_0^\infty \frac{\dd{\omega}}{\omega} e^{i\omega \dots}\). This integral does not converge since the real part has a (logarithmic) divergence. This IR-divergence is due to the fact that the asymptotic approximation is only true for \(r \gg 1/\omega\) and therefore fails for small \(\omega\). The spherical Bessel functions remain finite when approaching \(\omega \to 0\), while in the asymptotic form \(\frac{\cos{\omega\dots}}{\omega}\) diverges.
\item Instead of integrating over \(\omega\) one could also do the summation over \(l,m\) first. Taking care of the \(i^{\pm l}\) one either has to sum \(\sum_{l,m} Y_l^m(\theta,\phi) Y_l^{m*}(\theta',\phi') \sim \delta(\phi-\phi')\delta(\theta-\theta')\) or \(\sum_{l,m} (-1)^l Y_l^m(\theta,\phi) Y_l^{m*}(\theta',\phi') = \sum_{l,m} Y_l^m(\pi - \theta,\pi + \phi) Y_l^{m*}(\theta',\phi') \sim \delta(\phi-\phi'+\pi)\delta(\theta-\pi+\theta')\) which means that there's only a contribution in two directions namely the direction of the detector and the opposite direction. This is again an artefact of the asymptotic form but in this case it is due to the assumption that \(r\) is big. Since \(D^+(\vb{x},\vb{x}')\) has the same spatial size independent of \(\vb{x}\), moving it far away from the origin will shrink the corresponding solid angle. For \(r\) quite big all the contribution will appear only in one direction.  
\end{enumerate}

In asymptotic flat spacetimes (as the Schwarzschild metric) one often cannot find exact solutions but rather asymptotic forms of them. Therefore these two effects can (and will in our case) occur when calculating \(D^+\) in such spacetimes. 

\subsection{Inertial Observer}

We can now calculate the excitation rate for observers in minkowskispace. Let's start with an steady observer \(t(\tau) = \tau, \vec{x}(\tau) = 0\):
\begin{align}
D^+(x(\tau),x(\tau')) = -\frac{1}{4\pi^2}\frac{1}{(\tau-\tau'-i\varepsilon)^2}. 
\end{align}

Clearly \(D^+(x(\tau),x(\tau'))\) only depends on \(\Delta\tau = \tau-\tau'\). So we can use eq. \ref{equ:detector_final} to obtain:
\begin{align}
\cfrac{\mathrm{d}F_E(\tau)}{\mathrm{d}\tau} &= \int_{-\infty}^\infty \mathrm{d}\tau e^{-i E \tau} D^+(x(\tau), x(0))\\
	&= -\frac{1}{4\pi^2} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \mathrm{d}\tau e^{-i E \tau} \frac{1}{(\tau-i\varepsilon)^2} = 0\\
\end{align} 

For the last step use contour integration and close the contour in the lower half plane. Since \(e^{-i E \tau}\) drops to \(0\) for large \(\tau\) with negative imaginary part the integral is given by the sum over all residuals in the lower half plane. Because the \(\varepsilon\) moves the pole at \(\tau = 0\) into the upper half plane there are no poles in the lower half plane and therefore the integral vanishes. So there are no particle excitations for an observer on a inertial worldline\footnote{Note that by poincare invariance of \(D^+(x,x')\) one can always choose a frame in which an inertial observer does not move.} which simply means that he treats the minkowski vacuum as a state with no particles.\\

\subsection{The Unruh Effect}

Another interesting observer is an observer which is accelerating with an constant proper acceleration \(\alpha > 0\), i.e. \(t(\tau) = \alpha \sinh \tau/\alpha,\,x(\tau) = \alpha \cosh \tau/\alpha,\, y(\tau) = z(\tau) = 0\). Define \(\lambda = \tau/\alpha\). First calculate \(D^+\) for \(\varepsilon = 0\)\\

\begin{align}
-\frac{4\pi^2}{D^+(x(\alpha\lambda), x(\alpha\lambda'))} &= (\alpha \sinh \lambda - \alpha \sinh \lambda')^2 - \alpha^2 (\cosh \lambda - \cosh \lambda')\\
	&= \alpha^2 \left(-2 - 2\sinh\lambda \sinh\lambda' + 2 \cosh\lambda \cosh\lambda'\right)\\
	&= - 2 \alpha^2 \left(1 - \cosh(\lambda-\lambda')\right)\\
	&= 4 \alpha^2 \sinh^2\frac{\lambda-\lambda'}{2}\\
D^+(x(\tau), x(\tau')) &= -\frac{1}{16\pi^2\alpha^2} \frac{1}{\sinh^2\frac{\tau-tau'}{2\alpha}}
\end{align}

So again \(D^+\) only depends on \(\Delta\tau = \tau-\tau'\). So we will fouriertransform \(D^+\) according to eq. \ref{equ:detector_final}. Again we will close the contour in the lower half plane. Therefore we only need the residues in the lower half. But the hyperbolic sine has a root at \(0\) and therefore \(D^+\) will have a pole at \(\tau = \tau'\) on the real axis. This is the only point where the \(\varepsilon\) is important because it will move the pole away from the real axis. So in order to take the \(\varepsilon\) into account one only need to classify the behaviour of the pole at \(\tau = \tau'\).\\
So set \(\lambda' = 0\) and define \(\lambda_\varepsilon\) as the position of the pole for a specific \(\varepsilon\), which means it satisfies \((\sinh\lambda_\varepsilon - \frac{i}{\alpha}\varepsilon)^2 - (\cosh\lambda_\varepsilon - 1)^2 = 0\). Differentiating this twice with respect to \(\varepsilon\) and setting \(\varepsilon \to 0\) leads to (note that \(\lambda_0 = 0\)): \[\left(\frac{\mathrm{d}\lambda_\varepsilon}{\mathrm{d}\varepsilon}|_{\varepsilon = 0} - \frac{i}{\alpha}\right)^2 = 0\] Therefore is \(\frac{\mathrm{d}\lambda_\varepsilon}{\mathrm{d}\varepsilon}|_{\varepsilon = 0} = \frac{i}{\alpha}\) and for small \(\varepsilon\) the pole will move to upper half plane\footnote{Alternatively one can absorb positive functions into \(\varepsilon\) to get \(D^+(x(\tau), x(0)) \sim \frac{1}{\sinh^2\left(\frac{\tau}{2\alpha} - i \varepsilon\right)}\)}.\\

So we can ignore the pole at \(0)\) for the contourintegration. It is useful to use the expansion \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 \pi x} = \pi^{-2} \sum_k (x-k)^{-2}\) to obtain 
\begin{align}
D^+(x(\tau), x(0)) = -\frac{1}{4\beta^2\pi^2}\sum_k (\frac{\tau}{\beta} - ik)^{-2} = -\frac{1}{4\pi^2}\sum_k (\tau + ik\beta)^{-2}
\label{equ:unruh_sin_expansion}
\end{align} where \(\beta = 2\pi\alpha\):
\begin{align}
\cfrac{\mathrm{d}F_E(\tau)}{\mathrm{d}\tau} &= \int_{-\infty}^\infty \mathrm{d}\tau e^{-i E \tau} D^+(x(\tau), x(0))\\
	&= -\frac{1}{4\pi^2} \sum_{k>0}  \int_{-\infty}^\infty \mathrm{d}\tau e^{-i E \tau} \frac{1}{(\tau + ik\beta)^2}\\
	&= \frac{2\pi i}{4\pi^2} \sum_{k>0} \mathrm{Res}\left(e^{-i E \tau} \frac{1}{(\tau + ik\beta)^2}, \tau = -ik\beta\right)\\
	&= \frac{2\pi E}{4\pi^2} \sum_{k>0} e^{-\beta k E}\\
	&= \frac{1}{2\pi E} \left(\frac{1}{1-e^{-\beta E}} - 1\right)\\
	&= \frac{1}{2\pi} \left(\frac{E}{e^{\beta E}-1}\right)
\end{align} 

So the detector detects particles. The distribution contains the typical Planck factor\(\frac{1}{e^{\beta E}- 1}\). Actually  is the same distribution as an inertial observer would observe in a heat bath with temperature \(T = \frac{1}{k\ind{B}\beta} = \frac{1}{2\pi k\ind{B}\alpha}\). This can be seen by computing the thermal greens function in minkowskispace:

\begin{align}
D^+_\beta(x,x') &= -\frac{1}{4\beta^2} \frac{1}{\sinh[2](\frac{\pi}{\beta}\sqrt{(t-t')^2 - |\va{x}-\va{x}'|^2})}
\end{align} 

Evaluating this on a inertial trajectory, i.e. \(t = \tau, \vec{x} = \vec{x}' = t' = 0\) leads to the same formula as in equ. \todo{link}. So an accelerating observer sees the Minkowski vacuum as a heat bath.\\

\subsection{Equivalence Principle?}

One could now think that by equivalence principle a freely falling observer in a spacetime won't see any particle while an accelerating observer sees a heat bath according to his current acceleration. This is not even true in static spacetimes as the following lemma states:
\begin{lemma}
In a static spacetime with timelike killing vectorfield \(\vb{k}\) a static observer (moving only along \(\vb{k}\)) does not observe any particles.
\label{lemma:static_spacetime}  
\end{lemma}

Proof: Choose the coordinate system \((t,\va{y})\) with \(\partial_t = \vb{k}\) in which the metric looks like \(\dd s^2 =g_{tt} \dd{t^2} + g_{ij}\dd{y^i}\dd{y^j}\). In this frame the solutions of the klein gordon equations are given as in eq. \ref{equ:solutions_static} as \(u_{\omega, i} = u_{\omega, i} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\omega}}e^{-i\omega t} A_i\).
Since the observer moves only in \(\vb{k}\) direction he will have four-velocity \(\dot{\vb{x}} = \alpha \partial_t = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\qty|g_{00}|}} \partial_t\). \(\alpha\) is independent of \(\tau\) because the spatial coordinates of the observer are constant \(\va{y}(\tau) = \va{y}_0\). Integrating yields \(t(\tau) = \alpha \tau + t_0\).
Now we can evaluate \(D^+(\vb{x}(\tau), \vb{x}(\tau'))\). Recall that the vacuum state is given by \(a_{\omega,i}\ket*{0} = 0\):
\begin{align}
D^+(\vb{x}(\tau), \vb{x}(\tau')) &= \bra*{0}\phi(\vb{x}(\tau))\phi(\vb{x}(\tau'))\ket*{0} = \int \dd{\omega} \sum_i u_{\omega, i}(\vb{x}(\tau)) u_{\omega, i}^*(\vb{x}(\tau'))\\
	&= \int \dd{\omega} \sum_i \frac{1}{2\omega} e^{-i\omega (t(\tau)-t(\tau')} A_i(\va{y}_0)A_i^*(\va{y}_0)\\
	&= \int \dd{\omega} \sum_i \frac{1}{2\omega} e^{-i\omega \alpha (\tau - \tau')} A_i(\va{y}_0)A_i^*(\va{y}_0)
\end{align} 

One can see that \(D^+\) only depends on the difference \(\tau-\tau'\). Therefore we can apply eq. \ref{equ:detector_final}:
\begin{align}
\dv{F_E}{\tau} &= \int_{-\infty}^\infty \dd{\tau} e^{-i E \tau} D^+(\vb{x}(\tau), \vb{x}(0))\\
	&= \int \dd{\omega} \sum_i \frac{1}{2\omega} A_i(\va{y}_0)A_i^*(\va{y}_0) \qty(\int_{-\infty}^\infty \dd{\tau} e^{-i E \tau} e^{-i\omega \alpha \tau})\\
	&= \int \dd{\omega} \sum_i \frac{1}{2\omega} A_i(\va{y}_0)A_i^*(\va{y}_0) \delta(E + \omega \alpha) = 0
\end{align}

The deltafunction is always zero because \(E \leq 0\), \(\omega > 0\), and \(\alpha > 0\)\footnote{Here one can see why it is sensible to exclude \(\omega = 0\) because it would lead to an infinite transition rate to the groundstate \(E = 0\) which is clearly not physical}. So the observer does not detect any particles. qed.

This result might be surprising as in many spacetimes a static observer needs to accelerate in order to stay at his position (take the schwarzschild metric for example). On the other hand we will later show that observers on a circular orbit in the schwarzschild metric actually see particles. It seems that this contradicts the equivalence principle. However the equivalence principle only states that it is impossible to distinguish between flat space and curved space using only local measurements. The calculations above required integration over the whole worldline of the particle. Therefore this is a non local effect.\\
This can be also seen in Minkowski space. If the accelerating observer would stop accelerating (e.g at \(t = 0\)) he would still detect some particles for the rest of his live. Even an inertial observer will detect particles if he switches the detector on at \(t = 0\) (and not at \(\tau = -\infty\)) \todo{really?}.

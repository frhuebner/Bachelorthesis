\section{Klein-Gordon-Field}
(Quelle: Birell)
Consider a massless complex Klein-Gordon-field in a curved spacetime with metric \(g_{\mu\nu}\) given by the lagrangian:
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{L} &= \sqrt{|g|} g^{\mu\nu} \partial_\mu \phi\,\partial_\nu \phi 
\end{align*}

The equation of motion is given by the Euler-Lagrange-equation:
\begin{align*}
\sqrt{|g|}\nabla_\mu\nabla^\mu \phi = \partial_\mu \left(\sqrt{|g|} g^{\mu\nu} \partial_\mu \phi\right) = 0
\end{align*}

For solutions we also require to drop to zero at the boundary. Define a scalar product of two such solutions $\phi, \psi$ over a Cauchysurface \(\Sigma\) via:
\begin{align*}
(\phi|\psi) &:= i \int_{\Sigma} \mathrm{d}S^\mu\, \phi^*\nabla_\mu \psi - \psi\nabla_\mu \phi^* = i \int_{\Sigma} \mathrm{d}S^\mu\, \phi^*\overset{\leftrightarrow}{\nabla}_\mu \psi
\end{align*}

(Quelle: Townsend)The scalar product is independent of the choice of \(\Sigma\): Assume two Cauchysurfaces \(\Sigma\), \(\Sigma'\) and denote the 'sandwiched' region between them by \(A\). Then by Gauss' law
\begin{align*}
(\phi|\psi) - (\phi|\psi)' &= i\int_{\Sigma}\mathrm{d}S^\mu\, \phi^*\nabla_\mu \psi - \psi\nabla_\mu \phi^* - \int_{\Sigma'}\mathrm{d}S^\mu\, \phi^*\nabla_\mu \psi - \psi\nabla_\mu \phi^*\\
	&= i\int_{A} \sqrt{|g|} \mathrm{d^4}x\,\nabla^\mu \left(\phi^*\nabla_\mu \psi - \psi\nabla_\mu \phi^*\right)\\
	&= i\int_{A} \sqrt{|g|} \mathrm{d^4}x\,\phi^*\nabla^\mu\nabla_\mu \psi - \psi \nabla^\mu\nabla_\mu\phi^* = 0.
\end{align*}

Note that \((\phi^*|\psi^*) = -(\phi|\psi)^*\) and \((\phi|\psi)^* = (\psi|\phi)\).\\

Now choose a complete set of solutions $\{u_i\}$, such that
\begin{align*}
(u_i| u_j) = \delta_{ij},\,(u_i^*| u_j^*) = -\delta_{ij}\,\text{and}\,(u_i^*| u_j) = 0
\end{align*}

Using a Bra-Ket-like notation the completeness can be written by \(\mathbb{I} = \sum_i |u_i)(u_i| - |u_i^*)(u_i^*|\)

\section{Quantisation and Bogolubov Transformations}

(Quelle: arXiv1011.5875 )We can quantize the field by introducing the canonical commutation relations CCR on a cauchysurface \(\Sigma\) with (future directed) normal vector $S^\mu$:

\begin{align*}
[\phi(x),\phi(x')]_\Sigma &= 0\\
[\phi(x),\nabla_S \phi(x')]_\Sigma &= i\delta(x-x')\\
[\nabla_S \phi(x),\nabla_S \phi(x')]_\Sigma &= 0\\
\end{align*}

One can show that if they hold on one cauchysurface they hold on every cauchysurface.\\
Given a complete set of modes this leads to \(\phi = \sum_i u_i a_i + u_i^* a_i^\dagger\), with \([a_i,a_j^\dagger] = \delta_{ij}\).\\

Of course there are many different complete sets. One could also expand it in a different set \(\{v_j\}\): \(\phi = \sum_j v_j b_j + v_j^* b_j^\dagger\). The b's are given by \(b_j = \sum_i (v_j|u_i) a_i - (v_j^*|u_i) a_i^\dagger\)

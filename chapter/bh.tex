\section{Schwarzschild solution}
In this thesis we will only use the Schwarzschild-metric to describe stars and black holes (which means that they have no charge and no angular momentum). The metric is given by
\begin{align}
\rmd s^2 &= -f(r)\rmd t^2 + \frac{1}{f(r)}\rmd r^2 + r^2 \rmd\Omega &\rmd\Omega = \rmd\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta \rmd\phi^2 
\end{align}
where \(f(r) = 1-\frac{2M}{r}\). The metric is only valid outside the boundary of the star or for \(r > 2M\). The two vector fields \(\partial_t\) and \(\partial_\phi\) are killing.
